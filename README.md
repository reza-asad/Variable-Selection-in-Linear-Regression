Variable-Selection-in-Linear-Regression
=======================================

In this linear regression example I find significant variables using: Mallow's Cp, Regression Trees, Ridge Regression. 
Mallow's Cp is a very siimple way of selecting significant variables, however it only applies to linear regression
under certain assumptions. Regression trees is an easy and non parametric way to find relevant features, however there
is variability associated with this method. Ridge regression along with effective degrees of freedom is a more general
way to find important features, however it does not enjoy sparsity as LASSO does.
